<h1 align="center">📦 CreTail</h1>
<h3 align="center">Add Typescript, TailwindCSS and ESLint into your newly created project</h3>

<br/>

## Why? 🤔

This build tool is for those who are tired of installing and setting up TailwindCSS, ESLint, and Typescript whenever you create a new project. Build tools like vite are undoubtedly great, but unfortunately, the templates it provides don't include them. 

## ⌨️ How to use

1. Install the Cretail using the command: `npm i cretail -g`
2. In your newly created project folder, type `cretail` in your terminal
3. Pick the framework of your choice
4. Install the dependencies
5. Start the development server by typing `npm run dev`
6. Enjoy coding!

## 📦 Supported frameworks

1. React JS
2. Next JS
3. Svelte
4. Vanilla JS
5. More coming soon...

## 📄 Credit

Most of our templates are inherited from existed build tools:

1. vite
2. create-next-app

Huge thanks to them 💖.
